What is personally identifiable information (PII)?
Personally identifiable information (PII) is often referenced by US government agencies and non-governmental organizations. However, as the US lacks one overriding law about PII, the legal definition of the term may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and state to state.

The most common definition is provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which states that:

It says that:

PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.

However, the line between PII and other kinds of information is blurry. As stressed by the US General Services Administration, the “definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified”.

What pieces of information are considered PII?
According to NIST, PII can be divided into linked and linkable information.

Linked information
Linked information can also be defined as direct identifiers. 

Direct identifiers are unique to a person and can be used to identify an individual. A single direct identifier is typically enough to determine someone’s identity.
